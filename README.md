# BDC-Curves

A quick Unity prototype of a deformable sheet of paper using de-Casteljau-Bezier curves.

Quadratic curves are used to define the shape. Control points for the curve are manipulated by a simple physical constraint solver, and another part of the code ensures the paper stays approximately constant length.
